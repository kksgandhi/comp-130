This program involved calculating the cost and power creation of a house

The inputs are living room width, office length, number of bedrooms, bedroom width, bedroom length, MBR (Master bedroom) width, and MBR length
The outputs of the program are power generated and cost of the house
In order to calculate the cost, I first calculated the area, then calculated the perimeter
At the end of the cost function, I calculated the cost using the area and perimeter values
(Each area square foot costs $100 and each perimeter foot costs $80)
To calculate area, I added the areas of each room
The garage is 22 multiplied by 24 square feet
The Kitchen and Living area is 22 multiplied by the width of the living area
The master bedroom is the MBR width times the MBR Length
The Master Bathroom is the MBR length times 12
The other bedrooms are bedroom width times bedroom length
Since there are multiple bedrooms, I multiplied the area by the number of bedrooms
The office is the office length multiplied by the sum of four and the bedroom width
The bathrooms are 10 times the bedroom width, multiplied by two, since there are two bathrooms
The hallway is four feet wide, multiplied by the sum of 20 (the bathrooms) and bedroom length and the number of bedrooms
The perimeter was a bit more complicated
For the garage and kitchen, the perimeter is 24 plus two times the sum of 22 and the living width
The Master bedroom and bathroom is the master bedroom length times 2, plus the sum of the master bedroom width and 12 times two, minus the sum of 4 and bedroom width (because that is internal)
The offices and bedrooms had a perimeter of 4, plus the bedroom width, plus the sum of the office length, 20, bedroom length, and number of bedrooms, all multiplied by two, subtracting 24

In order to calculate power consumption this method was used
The area of panels was found by multiplying the sum of 4 and bedroom width by the sum of office length, 20, bedroom length (multipled by number of bedrooms) and master bedroom length
The area of panels was divided by the cosine of 25.9*pi/180, this accounted for the angle of the panels
This area was multiplied by 0.092903 to convert to square meters
The power was finally calculated by multiplying the square meters by 6.1 by 0.22 (the power generation and efficiency respectively)
