text generation recipe:
stop_generating_sentence(strings):
Returns false if string is empty or the last element in the string is not punctuation, checked by regex. (?.!)

Pick successor random:
generates a random real number 0-1
loops through every key in the input
If the key's value is greater than the random number, that key is returned as the random choice
Otherwise, the key's value is subtracted from the random number and the program moves on to the next key

form utterance nice:
returns "" if the input is empty
if the last element in the list is not punctuation, it appends a period
Capitalizes the first letter of the first element of the string
Loops through the list looking for punctuation, if it encounters it, then it capitalizes the next element in the list (after the punctuation)

generate text:
determines the sequence size of the markhov chain by looking at the size of the first element
Create a string list that will have words appended to it
while the stop generating function is false, loop on the list and keep adding words to it
look at the last elements of the string list we are building. The amount of elements we look at is based on the sequence size of the markhov chain input
Create a tuple of the last words of the string list, use the pick successor function to pick the next word. The inputs to pick successor are the tuple of words and the makhov chain itself.
append the choice chosen by pick successors to the string list we are building
break out of the loop if that is not possible
Return a string generated by form_utterance()

nueral net:
ensure that the sets have no intersection by using built in set functions
ensure that neither input or output set are empty
ensure that the number of hidden nodes to generate is a natural number
return None if any condition is not met
loop through the input node set
create a set of hidden nodes, and map each input node to the hidden node set
loop through the hidden node set
map each hidden node to the set of output nodes
loop through each output node
map it to the empty set
return all of the mappings
